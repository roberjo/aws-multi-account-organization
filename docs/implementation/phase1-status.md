## Technical Implementation Details

### Infrastructure as Code

**Terraform Modules Completed:**
- `aws-organizations/` - Complete with validation and outputs
- `control-tower/` - Supporting infrastructure and monitoring

**Configuration Management:**
- Environment-specific configurations
- Variable validation and constraints
- Output documentation
- State management with locking

### Security Implementation

**Service Control Policies:**
1. **Restrict Regions** - Limits operations to us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1
2. **Restrict Root User** - Prevents root user access except for account management
3. **Require MFA** - Enforces multi-factor authentication for user operations

**Tag Policies:**
1. **Required Tags** - Enforces Environment, Owner, Project, CostCenter tags

### Automation and Operations

**PowerShell Scripts:**
- `setup.ps1` - Initial environment setup and backend configuration
- `deploy.ps1` - Terraform deployment with validation and error handling
- `verify-deployment.ps1` - Comprehensive deployment verification

**Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch log groups for organization events
- SNS topics for notifications
- EventBridge rules for Control Tower events
